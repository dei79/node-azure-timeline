# Azure Timeline Service

## Overview
This package implements a simple to use timeline service to build twitter like timelines with azure tables. The 
following operations are available:

* post events to a specific subject and all his followers
* establish a relationsip between two subjects
* load the timeline of a specific subject

In addition the following features are planned

* analytics jobs to reduce the data and build aggregate functions
